Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.

**Motivation**

1.  *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    -   The dataset was created to analyze how audio features of songs from Spotify’s daily Top 50 charts and external variables like temperature correlate with valence (a measure of the positivity or mood of a song). This research addresses gaps in understanding how environmental factors and intrinsic song attributes influence the perceived mood of music.
2.  *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    -   The dataset originates from Spotify’s publicly available charts and was curated by Cristina Su Lam, currently studying at the University of Toronto, for research purposes.
3.  *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    -   No external funding was provided for this project.
4.  *Any other comments?*
    -   No.

**Composition**

1.  *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
    -   Each instance represents a song from Spotify’s Top 100 daily charts in Canada, including song metadata such as title, artist, rank, and streams.
2.  *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
    -   Approximately 17,400 instances (100 songs × \~174 days from June 1, 2024, to November 16, 2024).
3.  *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
    -   The dataset contains all Top 100 songs daily from Spotify’s Canadian charts for the specified timeframe. It does not include songs ranked below 100 or data from other countries.
4.  *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
    -   Raw metadata including: Rank, URI, Artist names, Track name, Source, Peak rank, Previous rank, Days on chart, Streams.
5.  *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   No explicit target variable exists in the raw dataset.
6.  *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
    -   No missing data in the raw files.
7.  *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
    -   Relationships between instances (e.g., songs trending over consecutive days) are implicit but not directly encoded in the dataset.
8.  *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
    -   No recommended data splits.
9.  *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   Redundancies may occur when songs persist in the Top 100 over consecutive days.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
    -   The dataset is self-contained and relies only on Spotify’s publicly available data.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   No confidential data is included.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
    -   No offensive content is present in the dataset.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
    -   No explicit sub-populations are identified.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
    -   No individual or user data is included in this dataset.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   No sensitive data is included.
16. *Any other comments?*
    -   No.

**Collection process**

1.  *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
    -   Data was manually downloaded from @spotify_charts official daily charts for Canada. 
2.  *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
    -   CSV files were downloaded from @spotify_charts website representing daily charts.
3.  *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?*
    -   Dataset is not a sample.
